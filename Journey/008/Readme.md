# Learning Docker

## Cloud Research

I'm learning Docker as part of the COM04-AWS100 - Push a Docker image to Amazon ECR repository project. I clicked the 'Get started with Docker' link under the References in the project. 

I downloaded and installed Docker desktop and followed the tutorial to create my first container and app.
