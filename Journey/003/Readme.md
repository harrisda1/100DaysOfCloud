SEC01-AWS200 â€” Create a new CMK in KMS and encrypt an object - Part 2

## Cloud Research

Well, I'm still working on the setup. I guesstimated that I was half-way thru when I'm actually about one-third of the way thru. Today I setup the EC2 instance that talks to the CloudHSM Cluster. I thought you spin up an instance and its ready to go. However, that is not even the case LOL. I was digging thru the AWS documentation and found out that I need to configure Security Groups, install the CloudHSM client, and then edit that client. I got two out of three done today. So its looking like part 3 tomorrow.
