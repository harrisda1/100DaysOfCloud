SEC01-AWS200 — Create a new CMK in KMS and encrypt an object - Part 1

## Cloud Research

I initially was going to only create a CMK using the default KMS settings and setup a S3 bucket. However, I wanted to check out the CloudHSM feature. Well, that setup was much longer than I anticipated. I'm about a little over half-way thru setting it up. That is why I titled this post part 1. Part 2 will be my results and mini-tutorial tomorrow, hopefully.
