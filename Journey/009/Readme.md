# Learning Docker Part 2

## Cloud Research

Part two of learning Docker. I finished one tutorial. I created a multi-container app and tried to load it into ECS. I bit off more than I can chew. I kept getting security related errors. I'm going to step back and start over with creating a repository and loading a Docker image. More or less follow the project, LOL!
