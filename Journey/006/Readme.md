# STR03-AWS200 - Create an EFS shared file system - Part 1

## Cloud Research

I have played with EFS briefly while studying for the SAA exam. I think this project is a good refresher and I can dig a little deeper on how it works and play with some of the advanced settings. Iâ€™m going to create the EFS first and then create the two EC2 instances. Today is part 1. I started setting up EFS and explored settings and documented what I did with screenshots. Tomorrow the plan is to complete the setup and standup the two EC2 instances.
