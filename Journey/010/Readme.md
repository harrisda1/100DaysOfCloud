# Switching Gears - Studying for SAA

## Cloud Research

Today, I resumed my SAA studies. It has been over a week and I don't want to get too far behind with the goal of taking the exam at the end of this month or early next month. My primary study tool is Stephane Maarek's SAA course on Udemy. I'm currently in Section 18 - AWS Monitoring and Audit.
